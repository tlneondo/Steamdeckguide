Steam Deck Guide

First thing, set a system password
Open up Konsole (the command line)

type:

passwd

and you can set a user admin password, you'll need this for other stuff
The username is Deck, and the user folder is located at /home/Deck/

Linux doesn't have C drive or anything, drives are mounted at folders within root (/)
Valve has things set up so the only partition you have write access to is mounted at /home
Your SD card if you have one is going to be mounted under /run/media , which is where modern linux tends to put "temporary" storage like USB flash drives


As the system is read only, except for /home, Valve uses something called Flatpak, which lets you install programs without touching the core of the system.
This is what you are using through the Discover store (though Discovery is buggy as fuck and the KDE Desktop team I think are fixing it)
These Flatpaks are "sandboxed" so that they're secure and don't have write permssions to fuck other shit up on the system.


All this is fairly well made, frankly most of the issues you'll have with the deck are STEAM BEING BUGGY AS FUCK AND NOT TELLING YOU WHATS BROKEN


Now, for accessing things remotely

Very important if you don't have a dock since trackpad typing sucks

for remote desktop, you'll want anydesk

you can install it in discover, or via terminal:

flatpak install flathub com.anydesk.Anydesk

Anydesk will have a code you can use on its desktop app and then you'll have remote desktop



for instances where you have a black screen and the steam deck seems like its bricked
or you just don't want to run a full remote desktop
lets set up the ssh server

Windows 10 should have ssh (Secure SHell) built in, but if not you can install cygwin on your windows pc

on the deck run this:

sudo systemctl enable --now sshd.service

	sudo is "superuser do", think of it like the User account control prompt under windows

	systemctl is a tool that controls background services
	
	enable --now just tells the system to start something now and on boot
	
	sshd.service is the ssh service
	
	

now on your windows PC you can open your terminal or cygwin and type:

ssh deck@steamdeck or
	ssh deck@[steamdeckIP address or hostname]
	
and now you can run terminal shit or even reboot your deck without touching it

More Imporantly: You can now add your steam deck to a FTP Client like Filezilla and use a nice GUI to send files over your network, which will make setting up emulation much easier.

	Also, if you're worried about people / bots being able to remotely login to your steam deck (the deck not your steam account), then you can use this:

	https://www.strongdm.com/blog/ssh-passwordless-login
	and disable password authentication, so people can't login without your key

	otherwise to disable the ssh server, run:
	sudo systemctl disable --now sshd.service


Okay

Now for actual cool shit

Valve's Proton is:

WINE (Wine Is Not an Emulator)
This is the compatibility layer that lets Linux run Windows Programs

	When You launch a steam windows game, Steam will generate a "Wine Prefix" (You can get punny and call it a bottle)
	Which is basically a fake C: Drive with its own windows registry, Program files, etc.
	These will be located in:
	~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/
	and each folder has the steam id number of the game being launched.
	
	any game launched under these "Prefixes" will also have the rest of the linux system mounted under a Z: drive




DXVK - Some dude in 2017 really wanted to play 2B's game on linux
So he wrote a whole DirectX11 driver in Vulkan

Then Valve spent a bunch of money fixing up the Mesa (open source driver project) Vulkan driver for AMD cards, known as RADV.
And it has a ton of features to make DXVK really really fast with minimal overhead.

On top of that, if a game has a native OpenGL or Vulkan driver, its likely that it'll run faster under Linux than under windows.
As its not actually having to convert anything.

As of now (Mesa 21.3 i believe) it's able to compile shaders at the same time as under windows
So Steam downloading shaders is purely for battery savings

Other people stepped up to support DirectX9 & 12.
There's one in progress for DX8, but Wine's WINED3D (which uses OpenGL instead of Vulkan) is more than sufficient for that.

The Deck uses something called Gamescope to scale up game windows using any kind of filtering or scaling you want.
It fakes a display with whatever specifications you want, which is how it changes refresh rate, and etc.
Highly recomend putting games in windowed mode and letting gamescope stretch things as it wants, it'll make them more resilient to resoltion and refresh rate changes.



HERE BE DRAGONS
HOW TO GET GAMES THAT DON'T WORK TO WORK
AND HOW TO INSTALL MODS AND NON STEAM GAMES



GameDevs (mostly japanese devs that are still figuring out that PCs aren't just for Eroge VNs)
Will use the default windows options for rendered cutscenes
Which puts them in a propriety codec, which Valve can't ship
Which means videos or audio don't work

Valve will reencode videos and ship them with the precompiled shaders, but even that can have issues
(I've played Persona 4 for hours and hours in Japanese only to get flashbanged by reencoded cutscene by valve where they only included the english dub)

So. 

You install ProtonGE (which is a fork of proton with fixes for other games and some stuff to get videos working)
You install it using a tool called ProtonUPQt, which makes things easy.
Then you set the game to use said proton version in the game properties.
GE means Glorious Eggroll, the guy who puts it together.
This is one of those things that's probably illegal for Valve to do but nobody cares about individual users.

This should be the first thing you try if something doesn't work.

IN GENERAL
DO NOT TRUST VERIFIED / NON VERIFIED STATUS
PEOPLE EITHER DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING
OR THEY PLAY THE FIRST 10 MINUTES AND SEE SOMETHING WORKS AND CHECK It

ALWAYS CHECK PROTONDB FOR REPORTS https://www.protondb.com/app/12140?device=any
IT WILL ALSO HAVE INFO FOR HOW TO GET THINGS RUNNING




-
Stuff you should install by name in discovery or run in terminal (just copy and paste the command)
We'll get to emulators after this, with Emudeck

	ProtonUpQT (tool I mentioned above for 
	flatpak install flathub net.davidotek.pupgui2

	Heroic (Handles Epic, GOG, & Amazon, Managed Wine Prefixes, this shit is the best)
	flatpak install flathub com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl

	Bottles (Very easy to use Wine "Bottle" manager, lets you make a bottle and run EXEs inside of them, I used this for Silent Hill 2 Enhanced edition)
	flatpak install flathub com.usebottles.bottles

	Lutris (older Wine Prefix manager
	flatpak install flathub net.lutris.Lutris


	ProtonTricks (install flatseal below as well) 
	(This will let you open an exe file, and choose what Steam Created Wine Prefix to run it under)
	I've use this to install fanpatches for stuff like Thief and Max Payne.
	**By Default, Wine prefixes is configured to not show hidden folders (.local, .steam, the period hides the folder)
	You can use protontricks to changed this setting (WineCFG) on the prefix, then you'll be able to tell a fan patch installer to point to a folder like say:
	/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/ThiefGold, or etc.
	
	I don't know why Valve hides their folder, its a pain in the ass
	
	flatpak install flathub com.github.Matoking.protontricks

Extra:
Luxtorpeda (through ProtonupQT)
This is a tool installed like ProtonGE that lets you use native source ports with stuff like boomershooters
I use it to play DoomMods, with the qzdl mod loader, and GZDOOM.


DLL injection mods:

Linux is smart and doesn't load whatever you put in a folder.
But this is also a pain in the ass for fixing buggy games.

if you run a game that has a fan patch, like say, dark souls with dxfix, dsfix injects itselft by overrideing a .dll file
You need to tell WINE to load the dll file manually

So go to steam and put something like this in the Launch options:
This is an example from max payne.
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="d3d8=n,b" %command% -skipstartup

WINEDLLOVERRIDES is saying to look for a file called d3d8.dll in the same folder as the exe, and use that

%command% is what steam uses for launching the game

-skipstartup is a max payne specific launch option that just skips an intro video (this is the same as launch options under windows)

	
emulators

https://www.emudeck.com/

Yes, there is some retroarch stuff for some systems, but I think they stay away when advisable
Even so,
emudeck genuinely does so much work to make things simple
Even if you don't use the included steam rom manager to add games directly to steam, the controller configurations and shortcuts added to the emulators themselves makes it a good starting point, as well as a reference point for making things work



Steam Deck Plugins (watch out, some plugins can be buggy)
https://decky.xyz/

Decky lets you do fun stuff like theme your system, play game music in the background, record video without framerate loss, all sorts of stuff,
But keep your steam deck on the stable channel when you do it.
